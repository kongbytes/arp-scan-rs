[![Build Status](https://saluki.semaphoreci.com/badges/arp-scan-rs/branches/master.svg?style=shields)](https://saluki.semaphoreci.com/projects/arp-scan-rs)

Find all hosts in your local network using this fast ARP scanner. The CLI is written in Rust and provides a minimal scanner that finds all hosts using the ARP protocol. Inspired by the awesome [arp-scan project](https://github.com/royhills/arp-scan).
